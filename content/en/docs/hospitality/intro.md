The NP Hospitality module aims to facilitate activities in restaurant, fast food and café environments. The supported layouts range from simple to complex, with multiple table locations, order-taking, moving of orders, kitchen information, and split billing.

With our cloud-based POS solution for restaurants, fast food chains and cafés, you can serve your guests in an efficient and convenient manner, reduce the ordering, as well as the waiting time, and offer quick payment. Orders are automatically sent to the kitchen printer or the KDS.

If you wish to use the Hospitality module, you first need to log into the NP Retail Restaurant Role to land on the Role Center. From there, you can get an overview of what's happening in the establishment, as well as the configuration screens required to set up the Restaurant/fast food environment in Business Central.
