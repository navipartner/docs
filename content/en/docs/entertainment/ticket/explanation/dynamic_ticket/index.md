A **Dynamic Ticket** is a ticket which has flexible admission setup. It can have more than one admission in [**Ticket BOM**]({{< ref "../../reference/ticket_bom_ref/index.md" >}}).

**Admission Inclusion** determines whether the admission is required or optional. When selling the ticket, optional admissions can be included. Those admissions can have their own price and sales line, depending on the **Additional Experience Item No.** on the **Ticket Admission**.
