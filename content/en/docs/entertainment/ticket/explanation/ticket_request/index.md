Ticket requests resemble orders. Whenever the ticket creation is initiated from the POS or from a web store, a request will be sent to the **Ticket Request** administrative section, that can be accessed from the Role Center. 

Each request has a unique token ID. However, if there are multiple admissions associated to the same request, the multiple number of identical tokens and authorization codes will be generated for them. 

In the **References** section of each request, you will be able to see the number of requested tickets, relevant customer data such as their email and customer number, and external order number/receipt number (depending on where the ticket has been issued from). 


{{< alert icon="📝" text="Whenever a customer arrives with a ticket or an order number that is invalid for some reason, it's recommended to start troubleshooting from the **Ticket Requests** administrative section, as it contains relevant customer-related information. If the ticket isn't tied to a specific customer, the recommended starting point for identifying the issue is the <b>Issued Tickets</b> section."/>}}
