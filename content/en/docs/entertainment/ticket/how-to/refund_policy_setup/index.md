Ticket refund policy is set up in the **Ticket BOM** page. By default, only the unused admissions are refunded.

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Ticket BOM** and choose the related link.
2. Navigate to the **Revoke Policy** column.
3. Choose between the following options for the refund policy:

   - **Unused Admission** - default option (until used).
   - **Never Allow** - makes it impossible to revoke the ticket.
   - **Always Allow** - makes it always possible to revoke the ticket.
