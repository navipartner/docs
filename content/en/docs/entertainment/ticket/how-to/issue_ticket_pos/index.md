The process of issuing a ticket from the POS follows the same flow as when standard items are sold on the POS. 

1. Open the POS.
2. Enter the **Item No.** for the tickets that should be issued.      
   The item numbers can be found in the **Ticket BOM** administrative section in Business Central.
3. Enter the **Quantity** of tickets to be issued. 
4. If a reservation is required, you need to pick a date and a time slot based on the configuration, and add the ticket to the POS. 
5. Once the date has been validated, proceed to **Payment**.
6. If the ticket has been set up for **Printing**, the ticket will be printed after the sale is finalized.
