## Designs

The **Designs** page is the main workspace in NP Designer, where users create and manage ticket layouts. New tickets can be started from a blank design or by duplicating an existing one. All designs are shown as cards with a preview, name, creation date, and language. Users can add new designs via the Add new design button, or organize them into folders using Add new folder.

Each design card also includes an options menu where users can delete, duplicate, and see the history of changes or rename designs.

### Ticket creation

The **Designs** page provides a canvas for creating and customizing ticket layouts, supported by intuitive tools for flexible design. At the top, users can name the design and set the language, while changes can be saved anytime using the Save button.

<!-- ![ticket_creation](images/Ticket_Creation.png) -->

On the left side of the editor, a toolbar gives access to design elements such as text, images, shapes, and QR or barcodes. Elements are added by dragging them onto the layout, where they can be positioned and resized.


### Toolbar

| Icon                                   | Desription                           |
| -----------                            | -----------                          |
|![text_icon](images/Text_Icon.png)       | Add plain text to the design canvas. Useful for displaying static content such as event names, dates, or ticket numbers. |
|![pic_icon](images/Pic_Icon.png)         | Upload and insert custom images like logos, banners, or backgrounds into the ticket layout. |
|![shapes_icon](images/Shapes_Icon.png)   | Insert simple graphical elements (rectangles, lines) for visual structure or decoration. |
|![qr_icon](images/QR_Icon.png)           | Embed QR codes or barcodes containing ticket data, links, or other scannable content. |
|![grid_icon](images/Grid_Icon.png)       | Small grid displays a grid of small squares across the ticket design area for more accurate element alignment, while Quarter grid inserts horizontal and vertical lines that divide the layout into four equal sections. |
|![Details_icon](images/Details_Icon.png) | Opens a sidebar displaying all elements currently added to the ticket layout. Each item is listed with its exact position and dimensions, allowing for precise selection, inspection, and editing. |

When a QR code is added to the design, clicking the ![edit](images/blue-pencil-icon.png) button allows the user to modify it. For example, add a URL, insert a logo in the center, and customize the QR code’s appearance.

The editor is designed to give full creative control while maintaining clarity and structure, making it easy to build visually consistent and print-ready ticket designs tailored to specific events or venues.

### Dynamic text fields

Within the NP Designer, text boxes support the use of dynamic fields, allowing users to insert live data directly from Business Central.

By typing **{{** inside a text box, a drop-down list of available fields appears. From this list, you can select the desired field to automatically display corresponding data in the design. These dynamic fields are linked to the related ticket in Business Central and can include information such as the given price, selected date, customer details, or other relevant ticket data.

Using dynamic fields ensures that all generated designs display accurate and up-to-date information retrieved directly from Business Central.

## Users

The **Users** page lists all registered users with their details and permissions. Administrators can add, edit, or remove users via the Add new user button or the action menu, and quickly find entries using the search bar.


## Connection

The **Connection** page is set up by a NaviPartner employee, while the description is provided solely to familiarize the customer with the process, explaining the tenant ID, environment, company, and the auto-generated API key that must be inserted into the NPDesigner Setup in Business Central.

## Fonts

The **Fonts** page allows users to view and manage all fonts available within the system. Each font is listed by name, with a live Preview displaying how the typeface appears in both regular and bold styles.
A search bar at the top enables users to quickly find specific fonts by name. New fonts can be added by clicking the Add new font button in the top-right corner of the page.
 * {{< alert icon="📝" text="Only TrueType (.ttf) font files can be uploaded."/>}} 

## Medias

The **Medias** page serves as a central library for all image assets used in ticket designs, such as logos and backgrounds. Media files can be added or removed as needed and are available for direct use within the design interface.

## Settings

The **Settings** page contains the Organization Settings section, which includes Date Settings for configuring how dates are displayed across the organization. This global setting ensures that all users see dates in a consistent format throughout the system.

In the Date Format field, user can define the preferred date format using standard format tokens and preview the result before saving.
Below the main setting, the Format Tokens section explains the available tokens, while Format Examples provides common combinations with sample outputs for reference.

Once the desired format is selected, click Save Settings to apply the changes.


## Business Central

After a successful connection, the integration between NP Designer and the Business Central environment is established, and the user can access the Business Central side for ticket usage.

### NPDesigner Setup Card

The NPDesigner Setup page serves as the place for configuring the integration between NP Designer and Business Central. On this page, the URL of the NP Designer application is entered, along with the API key generated by the application. The fields Public Ticket URL and Public Order URL are prepopulated and do not require manual input.
 
### Ticket Bill-of Material (BOM)

On the Ticket Bill-of-Material page, the Design layout label field is defined. This is where the user specifies which NP Designer layout will be applied, ensuring that the correct label format is used whenever tickets are generated.

To open the Ticket Bill-of-Material, these steps should be followed:
* Step 1: Go to Ticket Item List.
* Step 2: Select a Ticket Item Card.
* Step 3: From there, navigate to Ticket Bill of Material.
