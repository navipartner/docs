Memberships offer tailored access to exclusive products, services, or perks based on the specific membership level chosen by the customer. This system effectively controls access to premium content reserved solely for club members.

Memberships can be sold independently, bundled with product purchases, or manually assigned, seamlessly integrating member privileges into the online store experience.

The hierarchy of the Membership module in NP Attractions is as follows:

1. Member community - stores all memberships
2. Membership - stores the validity and transactional data
3. Member - stores personal information of the membership users
4. Member card - stores identification information about members

You can make the Membership module pages by choosing the **NP Retail Entertainment** role center upon entering Business Central.
