All points for customers can be followed from the **Membership Card**. In the **Points** tab of the **Membership Card** you can see the awarded points (sale and refund), redeemed points, expired points, and remaining points:

If there is need for more details, all these fields are flow fields, and with a drop it is possible to see all membership point entries from which these points are created.

For example, if we drop in **Awarded Points (Sales)** – 7619, we will see the following entries:

There are three reports created in NP Retail for tracking points:

- **Membership Points Summary** – this report should be used to show points by a membership/customer number. In this report you can see the awarded, redeemed, expired, and remaining points:

- **Membership Points Value** – this report is used for checking the value of points available per a customer/membership number.

- **Membership Points Detail** – this report is used if you need to see all point movements per a member.
