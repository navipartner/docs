NP Attraction is all-in-one ticketing and membership management system that streamlines sales and validation of tickets and memberships.

You can create ticket types for all kinds of events and venues, and manage ticket sales in the Business Central database. 

It is also possible to create various types of memberships defined by their benefits, duration, upgrade capabilities, and renewal policies. 
  
Additionally, you can create, monitor, and keep track of group events, book guide resources, and create invoices from events. During events, guests can make purchases from restaurants or shops, and add these items to an open sales order.

All data from the ticket sales, stores, and caf√©s is collected and managed in Business Central.
