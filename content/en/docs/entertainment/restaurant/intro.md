If you wish to use the Restaurant module, you first need to log into the NP Retail Restaurant Role to be able to land on the Role Center for the NP Retail Restaurant. From there, you can get an overview of what's happening in the restaurant, as well as the configuration screens required to set up the Restaurant environment in Business Central.
