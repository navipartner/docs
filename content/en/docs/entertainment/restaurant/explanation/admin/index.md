The **Admin** menu can be opened from the **Restaurant Seating Plan View**. You can set up different administrative functions that suit your business needs. The main advantage of this button on the **Restaurant Seating Plan View** is that you don't need to go to the **Sales** view to access its contents, i.e. you don't need to create a waiter pad to move to the **Sales** view. 

The following POS menu buttons for administrative tasks can be placed under the **Admin** menu: 

- Log out of the POS
- EOD function
- Print functions (e.g. to reprint tickets)
- Any administrative report you need
