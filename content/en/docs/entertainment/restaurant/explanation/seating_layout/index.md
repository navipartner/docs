The following administrative sections can be used to set up seating in restaurants:

## Seating locations

You can divide each restaurant into multiple areas in the **Seating Locations** administrative section.

The setup is reflected in the **Restaurant Seating Plan View**:

## Seating List

The **Seating List** contains the number of seats and tables available in a restaurant. It also contains the status and the waiter pads attributed to the tables.

You can add new seating in this administrative section, or in the **Restaurant Plan View**.
