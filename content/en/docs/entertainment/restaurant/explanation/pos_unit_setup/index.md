In the POS Unit Card, you need to set up the **POS View Profile** and the **POS Restaurant Profile** for the Restaurant module.

## POS View Profile

If you wish to be greeted with the **Seating Floor View** as soon as you've logged into the POS unit, you need to select **Restaurant View** in the **Initial Sales View** dropdown in the **POS View Profile**
