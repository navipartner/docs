[<ins>Softpay<ins>](https://www.softpay.io/) is an app-based terminal which can be intregrated into Point Of Sales (POS) systems.

From the customer’s side, the payment flow when purchasing from a local store is as follows:

 - The customer brings the items to the register.
 - When all items are scanned, the payment is initiated, and the POS app switches to the Softpay app.
 - The customer puts a credit card close to the device's NFC reader, and is prompted to provide a PIN if the amount is high enough, or if they have completed purchases without using a PIN for some time.

However, to enable Softpay, the following procedure needs to be performed in NP Retail first:

- Have an Android phone with the Softpay app **Softpay - mPOS terminal** installed.
