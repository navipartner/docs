   The options for setting up the Raptor integration are displayed.
2. Provide the following information:

| Field Name      | Description |

| **API Key** | The API key is assigned by Raptor. | 
| **Base URL** | The base URL is provided by Raptor. The default value is *https://api.raptorsmartadvisor.com*. It is required for the Raptor data retrieval processes. |
