Before you can use Pepper on your POS, you need to set up the button on the POS and install Pepper locally on your computer through the POS.

To set up a **Pepper** button in the **SALE-LEFT** part of the POS, follow the provided steps:

1. Open the POS unit on which you wish to add the button.
2. Open the POS editor by pressing the <image src="Images/cog.PNG" width="30" height="30"> icon.    
   The edit mode is enabled.
3. Press the cell in the **SALE-LEFT** part of the POS screen in which you wish to place the button, followed by **Edit** in the dropdown.
4. Add the **Caption**, and open the **Action** dropdown list.
5. Search for Pepper and select the **EFT_PEPPER_INSTALL** action.       
6. Press **Save**, and exit the edit mode.
   Since the **POS Action** doesnâ€™t have any further parameters, the button is now set up. You can now install Pepper locally through the POS.
