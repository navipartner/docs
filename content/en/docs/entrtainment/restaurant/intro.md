NP hospitality (restaurant module) aims to support activities in restaurant and caf√© environments. The functionality supports a restaurant setup with multiple table locations, order-taking, moving of orders, kitchen information, and split billing. It runs on stationary POS, as well as MPOS, utilizing the NPR transcendence for easy-to-use interface. 

With the restaurant module, you can serve your guests in an efficient and convenient manner, reduce the ordering time, as well as the waiting time, and offer quick payment. Orders are automatically sent to the kitchen printer to save time and avoid any potential misunderstandings.
