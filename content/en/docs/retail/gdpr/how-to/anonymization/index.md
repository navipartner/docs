In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, it is possible to perform anonymization of customer data. Anonymization refers to the process of removing direct and indirect personal identifiers that may be used to lead to identification of an individual being. This process can be performed when the business relationship with some customers is concluded, and they should no longer be referenced in the documents created in the system. 

To do anonymize customer data, follow the provided steps.
