Store groups are used for grouping POS stores with similar characteristics or classifications, so that statistics reports can be developed for a group, instead of having to develop multiple individual reports for each store.

To configure store groups, follow the provided steps:

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Store Groups**, and choose the related link.        
2. Populate all the necessary fields.

| Field Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Code** | Specifies the reference code for the store groups. |
| **Description** | Specifies a brief description for the group of stores. |
| **Blank Location** | Specifies whether a store with a blank location is allowed in the group or not. |

3. Once the store groups are defined, you can assign them to individual POS stores under the **Reporting** section.
