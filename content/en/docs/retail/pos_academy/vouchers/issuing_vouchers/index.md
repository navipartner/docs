## Issuing gift vouchers

![vouchers6](vouchers6.png)

Depending on the setup, when issuing the gift voucher, the salesperson will input the quantity, the unit price of the Gift Voucher, and any customer details needed.

## Issuing credit vouchers

Depending on the setup, on issuing a Credit Voucher, the system will suggest the value as per the sales line. The salesperson can accept the suggestion or insert a value themselves.  

## Redeeming gift/credit vouchers

On redeeming, both Gift Vouchers and Credit Vouchers use the POS Action **SCAN_VOUCHER**. The only difference is in the parameter in which you can set which **Retail Voucher Type** is being used.
