The POS Academy is a series of training guides and videos that enable users to become more competent users of NaviPartner’s cloud-based POS solution, such as NP Retail.

Its main purpose is to provide a standardized, comprehensive training program for our users. The guides are based around a fictional company and they build upon one another, taking the viewer on a journey through all the necessary steps in POS operation and configuration. They showcase real-life examples and best practices, and their goal is to both demonstrate a way of configuration and inspire viewers to explore new ideas and options.
