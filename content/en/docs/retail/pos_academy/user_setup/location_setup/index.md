Locations are places such as warehouses where you can buy, store, or sell items. Business Central uses locations to keep track of inventory.  

If youâ€™re tracking stock in different stores in NP Retail, you need to assign the location to the **POS Store** on the **POS Store Card**. On that location, you can carry out the processes of sale and replenishment.  

Refer to the [<ins>Learning Material of Business Central<ins>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/inventory-how-setup-locations) to learn how to set locations.
