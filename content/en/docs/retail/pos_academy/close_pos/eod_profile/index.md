This topic goes through the process of closing the POS as a part of the end-of-day process. 

After all sales are finalized and the store is closed, you also need to go through the process of closing the POS. Closing can be done for every individual POS unit, or it can be done from one POS unit for multiple or all POS units simultaneously.
