After all sales are finalized and the store is closed, you also need to go through the process of closing/balancing the POS. You can balance the POS unit several times a day, but it's usually done during the end-of-day period between work shifts. The procedure can be triggered from each POS unit individually or from one master POS unit.

The entire procedure consists of two parts:

1. [<ins>Configure the POS balancing feature<ins>]({{< ref "../../../pos_processes/how-to/balance_config/index.md" >}})        
   The setup of the POS balancing feature is mainly done as a part of the **POS End of Day Profile** setup in Business Central. 
2. [<ins>Generate end-of-day report (POS balance)<ins>]({{< ref "../../../pos_processes/how-to/generate_eod/index.md" >}})      
   Once the previous step has been completed, you can move on to generating EOD reports from the POS unit itself.
