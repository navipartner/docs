The item [add-on menu]({{< ref "../../pos_processes/reference/item_addon_ref/index.md" >}}) allows users to attach an item or a set of items while going through the sale process of a main item on the POS. There are two different types of item add-on configurations:

- Item add-on attached to the specific main item - the addon is purchased alongside the main item as an accessory, warranty, or a component of the main item.
- A standalone item add-on menu - the addon is purchased on its own; refers to items that can be selected from a defined list or a menu. 

You need to take the following actions before attaching the add-ons to the main item:

- [Create item add-ons]({{< ref "setup/index.md" >}}).
- Attach the item add-ons to the main item that you want to use it with.

You need to perform the following setup if you want to create the add-on menu as a standalone:

- [Create item add-ons]({{< ref "setup/index.md" >}}).
- Create the POS button for the Item add-on menu to be used in the POS.
