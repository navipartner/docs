As soon as you set up the Replication Module, the provided data will be synchronized, or replicated, automatically between the source company and the target company. To complete the setup, follow the provided steps:

## Setup in the Source (Master) companies

1. Open the **Replication Setup (Source Company)** page.
2. Click **Enable Replication Counter**.     
   This toggle is disabled by default to reduce overhead expenses for companies which aren't used as a source for the data replication process.

## Setup in the Target (Store) companies

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Replication API Setup List**, and choose the related link.    

{{< alert icon="📝" text="By using the <b>Create Default Setup</b> action (under <b>Process</b> in the ribbon), multiple predefined setups are created and grouped according to the master data, for example customer-related data, vendor-related data, and so on."/>}}

{{< alert icon="📝" text="In a multi-company scenario, actions <b>Export Replication Setups</b> and <b>Import Replication Setups</b> can be used to export and import setups from one company to another in XML format."/>}}

2. Open the first **CUST_NPAPI V1** setup.
3. Enter the necessary information in order to enable the setup (the setup is disabled by default).
   
  {{< alert icon="❗" text="If the replication is made from an external database, state the correct external URL in the <b>Service Base URL</b> field and enable the <b>External Database</b> toggle switch."/>}}
 
4. Click the ellipsis button next to the **Source Company Name** field, and select the company from which you want to import data.   
   
  {{< alert icon="📝" text="If the <b>External Company</b> is disabled, you can select a company from the current database, otherwise the system makes a web API request to the external database to retrieve companies and you can select a company from that database."/>}}


   The **Source Company Id** is automatically populated. This field is used by the system when it makes API requests to retrieve data from the selected company.

5. Enter the **Source Company Tenant** if you work in a multitenant environment.
6. Select the authorization type and the necessary credentials, then enable the authorization if needed.
7. (Optional) Enter an email address in the **Error Notification Email Address** field.      
   This will make the system send a predefined email to that address if any errors occur during the data replication process. 
8. Click **Test Connection** to see if the connection can be established.
9.  Click **Enable** if the connection was successful.     
    After confirmation, the replication setup is enabled and all data in the **Source Company** is imported into the target company.

  {{< alert icon="📝" text="When enabling the replication setup, a Naviconnect Import Type and a Job Queue Entry are created in the background, so the import is done automatically based on setup of these records."/>}}
  

## Next steps

After you're done configuring the **General** replication setup options, you can also configure the **Endpoints** and **Special Field Mappings**.

### Configure Endpoints

The import is done based on the **Endpoints** section of the **Replication API Setup Card**. If necessary, you can configure it.

It is possible to:

- disable specific endpoints (which will terminate data import for those tables).
- change the order in which tables are imported.
- update the **Replication Counter** field manually.
- update the **Replication Counter** field automatically via the **Get Last Replication Counter** action. When you use this, the system makes a web request to retrieve the Last **Replication Counter** from the source database table. This should be used if the starting point of the replication needs to be changed.
- add a **Fixed Filter** which will be added to the URL when sending the request. You can use this option if only some of the records need to be replicated and not the whole table. Example: *number gt '10003' and number lt '10008'*. [See more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-nav/using-filter-expressions-in-odata-uris).
- add new endpoint configuration.

### Configure Special Field Mappings

In general, the fields for each table (endpoint) are mapped automatically. In the API page used as a webservice, most fields are named after the table fields in the CamelCase.    

**Example:**   
**Customer Posting Group** --> **customerPostingGroup**

However, there are special cases when the field names are different. You can use the **Special Fields Mappings** page to map these. This page is accessed by clicking the **Manage** button, followed by the **Special Field Mappings** button in the **Endpoints** panel. 

**Example:**

### Check Missing Fields

You can check if there are table fields that are not handled by the Data Replication module by running the **Check Missing Fields** report.

This report employs web requests to compare the metadata of the Business Central APIs with the fields from the actual tables. Then, it maps out the fields that aren't handled via the API, and are thus skipped in the data replication process.
