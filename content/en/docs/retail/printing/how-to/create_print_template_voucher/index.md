Customers who have vouchers can use them to purchase various items, instead of using cash or other payment methods. There are different types of vouchers, and most of them are printable. You can create print templates that are specifically used when printing vouchers, or use the predefined ones. 

To set up voucher print templates, follow the provided steps: 

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Print Template List**, and open the related link.    
   On fresh installation, an empty template list is displayed.
2. Click **Actions** in the ribbon, followed by **Download Template data** in the dropdown list that is displayed.    
   After a few moments, you will have a full list of preset ready-to-use print templates compatible with the NP Retail solution.
3. Search for the **MEMBER_GIFT_VOUCHER** template for [<ins>line printing<ins>]({{< ref "../receipt_print_template/index.md" >}}) in the list.    
4. Open the template card, and click **Edit Data Items** in the ribbon.      
   The main data source is the **TM Ticket** table. It contains all basic information that needs to be referenced from the printed tickets.
