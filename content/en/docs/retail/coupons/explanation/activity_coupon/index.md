Activity coupons provide discounts on specific items and can be either printed or obtained from magazines or newspapers. Multiple coupons can share the same coupon number, but each coupon can only be redeemed for a single item.

## How activity coupons work

- Coupons apply a fixed discount amount or a discount percentage to eligible items.
- There is no priority among items - each coupon applies to only one eligible item per use. 

## Example usage

- A customer purchases two eligible items but has only one coupon. The coupon applies to only one of the items.
- If the customer has two coupons, both items can receive a discount. 

## Rules for coupon application

If two items with the same item reference number are purchased during the same sale, and the customer has provided two coupons, they are applied to both items respectively, as each item is unique. Therefore, the salesperson will scan the item twice instead of changing the quantity of the first item to 2 on the first sale line. Afterwards, the salesperson will scan the coupons.

Some items have serial numbers. If this is the case, the coupon will be applied to the combination of the item and the serial number (as a unique item). If the same Item & Serial No. is rescanned, the second time will automatically be rejected.

Two different activity coupons may be applied to the same item in certain cases. These coupons may offer different discount amounts/percentages. If the item A is on the list for the EUR30 & EUR50 coupon discount, you can apply EUR30 on the first line, and EUR50 on the second line.
