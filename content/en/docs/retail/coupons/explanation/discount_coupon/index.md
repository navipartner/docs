Discount coupons provide a reduction in price, or an extra benefit given to customers when they purchase items. Discount coupons positively impact sales in physical and online stores, as they are attractive to both customers who are new to the brand and returning customers who wish to purchase items in larger quantities. 

The most common discount coupon types are: 

| Discount coupon type      | Description | Example | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
|  Discount-percent discount coupons | They provide a discount to the retail price of the product/service. | A coupon of 10% off the next flight booking on a flight-booking website. |
| Discount on a minimum purchase | They require customers to spend a minimum amount to be eligible for a discount | 20% off on purchases of 200EUR or more in a specific category at a retail store. |
| Complementary service discount coupons | They provide additional free services on top of the purchased item. | Free fitting and installation of a purchased air conditioner.  |
| Buy-one-get-one coupons | These coupons provide an additional free item for a purchase of an item in the same category. | Purchase a shampoo bottle and get an additional one for free. |
|  New customer coupons | These coupons provide a welcome discount to new customers of a brand. | For the first purchase, every customer gets 5% off the entire bill. |
