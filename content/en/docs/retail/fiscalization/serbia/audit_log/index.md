The **RS POS Audit Log Aux. Info** table contains information on whether the transaction was sent to the Tax Authorities or not, as well as the path for checking the correctness of the fiscal bill. Transactions are automatically sent to the Tax Authorities and marked as sent. If they have not been sent, you can run the **Sent to Tax Auth.** action to send them.
