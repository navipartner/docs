There are five discount types that can be chosen on the **Mixed Discount** card.

## Total amount per Min. Qty.
  
This mix discount type is used for defining the total amount that will be paid for the minimum quantity.

In the example provided above, if a customer buys 5 items, the total amount that they will pay is 1.500. If a customer buys 6 items, they will pay (1500/5)*6=1800. The difference between the unit price and the total amount will be applied as a discount to the items.

## Total Discount %      
  
This mix discount type is used to define discount percentage that will be used to calculate the discount if a customer buys the minimum quantity. When this type is selected, the **Total discount %** field is displayed.

In the example provided above, if a customer buys 5 items, they get the 10% discount on all items which are in the **Mix Discount Lines**. This discount applies to the unlimited quantity of an item. The difference between the unit price and the total amount will be applied as a discount to the items.

## Total Discount Amt. per Min Qty.

This mix discount type is used to define the total discount amount that will be assigned to the sale if a customer purchases the minimum quantity.

## Priority Discount per Min. Qty.

When this discount type is selected, the **Item Discount Quantity** field is displayed.

In the example above, if a customer buys 5 items, they will get 10% discount on two items. This discount will be applied to every set of 5 items until the maximum quantity is reached.

## Multiple discount Levels

This discount type is used if you need to set up different discount percentages for different quantities.

When this type of discount is selected, a new tab **Mix discount levels** is displayed. In it, users can set up discount percentages for different quantities.

In the example above, if a customer buys 5 items, they will get 5% discount on items from the **Mix Discount Lines**, but if they buy 15 items, they will get the 10% discount.

## Combination Mix Type

If you select **Combination** in the **Mix type** field in the **General** tab, in **Mix Discount Lines** there will be **New part** and **Part card** actions.

When you select **New Part**, a new window will be opened to prompt you to create a combination part to use in the mixed discount. After entering the details for the combination part, the card will be automatically associated with the **Mixed Discount** card. When a combination part card has been created, it can be accessed again when you select the combination part on the **Mix Discount Lines**, and select the **Part Card**. This will open the **Combination Part** card, so that it can be either reviewed or edited.

In the **Mix Discount Lines** for this type of mix discount, you can configure the following options:

| Field Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Part Code**     | This code is a reference to the **Combination Part** card already created in the system. You can either make a selection from the list or create a new one using the **New Part** option.     |
| **Description**   | The description from the **Combination Part** card. |
| **Min Qty.**  |  The **Min. Qty.** from the **Combination Part** card which will trigger the discount. |
| **Min expected amount** | This is calculated as the minimum amount which will be expected as discount based on the minimum quantity configured on the **Combination Part** card. |
| **Max. Expected Amount** | This is calculated as the maximum amount which will be expected as discount based on the maximum quantity configured on the **Combination Part** card. |
