In each transaction you can apply different types of discounts depending on your business needs. For example, if discounts are applied to specific items during a certain period, you can use [<ins>Period Discounts<ins>]({{< ref "how-to/period_discounts/index.md" >}}). If you want to manually assign discounts on a sale (on a total amount or on a specific item in a sale) you can use [<ins>Line/Total Discounts<ins>]({{< ref "how-to/total_discount/index.md" >}}).

If you want to give a discount on a specific combination of items, you can use [<ins>Mix Discounts<ins>]({{< ref "how-to/create_mix_discount/index.md" >}}). If you want to apply discounts to larger item quantities or a combination of different items, you can set up special prices for different quantities of items. You can also set up special discounts for customers who have special price-related benefits.
