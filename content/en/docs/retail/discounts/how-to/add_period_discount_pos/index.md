Make sure the prerequisites are met and follow the provided steps to manually add a period discount to items on the POS.

#### Prerequisites

-	You need to have the [<ins>period discount created in Business Central<ins>]({{< ref "../period_discounts/index.md" >}}). In our example, the period discount is created for the item 70006. The price is **1200** during that period instead of the regular price of **1500**.
-	The period discount needs to be active and the date of the sale needs to be within the date range during which the period discount is effective.

#### Procedure

To add a period price in a sale:

1.	Provide **70003** in the **Item no.** box in the top right corner.       
    A new sales line is added with the price from the **Period Discount Page â€“ 1200**. The discount percentage and the discount amount are calculated.
