Make sure the prerequisites are met, and follow the provided steps to add customer discount on the POS:

#### Prerequisite

-	A discount for the specific item-and-customer combination needs to be created in **Sales Prices**. In our example, the combination between the customer D000002 and the item **70005** is created. A special discount of 5% will be given for quantities lower than 5, and for quantities of 5 and up the 10% discount will be applied. 

#### Procedure

To add discount for customer in sale:

1.	Provide **70005** in the **Item no.** box in the top right corner.    
    A new sales line is added with the regular initial price.
2.	Click **Customers** in the bottom right corner, followed by **Select Customer** in the pop-up window that is displayed.
3.	Select the customer **D000002**.     
    The customer is added to the sale. The discount percentage of 5 is added, as well as a discount amount, and the new **Amount Including VAT** is calculated. 
4.	Click **Change Quantity**.     
    A pop-up window for providing the new quantity is displayed.
5.	Set the quantity to **5**.     
    The discount percentage is changed to **10**, while the discount amount and the new **Amount Including VAT** is calculated.
