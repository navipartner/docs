Discount priority can be used when certain discount types need to be prioritized over the others. 

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Discount Priority List**, and choose the related link.     
   The **Discount Priority List** is opened as a result. By default, it consists of different types of discounts on a priority list of 1-5.  
2. Use the **Priority** field to sort priorities in a desired order. 

    {{< alert icon="❗" text="If priority 3 has a better discount than priority 1, the discount with priority 1 will still be higher in the order of priority. "/>}}
