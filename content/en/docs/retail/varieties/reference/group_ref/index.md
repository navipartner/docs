| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Code**       | Specifies the unique code for a variety group.    |
| **Description**   | Specifies a short description for a variety group which informs users about its characteristics.      |
| **Cross Variety No.**  | You can choose a variety number (1 to 4) that will be displayed in the matrix horizontally. It is possible to override this selection on the **Item Card** later on.  |
| **No. Series** | Specifies the number series that will be used in the **Copy Naming Variety X** field.  |
| **Variety 1** | Specifies the variety that should be added as the first variety on the item. |
| **Variety 1 Table** | Specifies the variety table that should be added as the first variety table on the item. | 
| **Create Copy of Variety 1 Table** | If ticket, a copy of the table selected in the **Variety 1 Table** field will be created. All values in the table will be copied 1:1. |
| **Copy Naming Variety 1-1** | The following options are available: **Blank** - this selection results in an error if **Create Copy of Variety 1 Table** is ticked; **Table Code + No. Series** - the code of the **Variety 1 Table** + the next number from the number series will be used; **Table Code + Item No** - the code of the **Variety 1 Table** + the **Item Number** will be used.
