The **Variety** administrative section contains the list of varieties created in the environment, along with some of their basic properties. The following options are available when setting up varieties in this section:

 Field Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Code**       | Specifies the unique code for a variety.    |
| **Description**   | Specifies a short description for a variety which informs users about its characteristics.      |
| **Use in Variant Description**  |  This field is taken into account only if the **Variant Description** or **Variant Description 2** fields are set to **Variety table setup first 50** or **Variety Table Setup Next 50**. If enabled, this variety will be used to generate the description to the variant.  |
| **Custom Description** | If an item and a variant are selected in sales/purchase lines, the item description will be copied on the sales/purchase line description, and the variant will be copied in the **Description 2**.  |
|  **Pre Tag in Variant Description**  | The description on the variant will be generated with this tag in front of the value.  |
|  **Use Description Field**  | Specifies if it's the **Code** field or the **Description** field of the **Variant Value** that is used in generating the variant description.  |
