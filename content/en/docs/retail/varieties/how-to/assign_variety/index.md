1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Items** and open the related link.   
2. Open the **Item Card** of an item you wish to assign the variety to. 
3. Select the **Variety Group** in the **Variety** section.     
   All other fields are populated automatically with the data from the variety group you add.
   The varieties are now assigned to the item, but it's also necessary to assign the values of varieties which this item has. 
4. Click **History** in the ribbon, followed by **Variety Maintenance**.     
   The matrix with different values is opened as a result. 
5. Tick the checkboxes in the matrix to create combinations of values that the item is going to have.       
   In the provided example, the item `10025 - dress` has the following combinations of size and color: `XXS Black`, `XXS Blush`, `S Black`, `S Blue`, and `XS Blue`.
