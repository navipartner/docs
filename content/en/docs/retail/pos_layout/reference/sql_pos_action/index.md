When menu buttons are added for the **LOOKUP** POS action, you can set filters on the item table using an SQL statement. 

![pos_action_sql_filter](pos_action_sql_filter.png)

If you use the example from the provided screenshot - *SORTING(Description) ORDER(Ascending) WHERE(Inventory Posting Group=FILTER(SHOP))* - which means that the list will have items whose *Inventory Posting Group = SHOP*, and it is sorted in alphabetical order according to the item names. 

Some examples of statements that can be set with the **LOOKUP** POS action:

- Item Lookup by Specific Item Category:       

  SORTING(Description) ORDER(Ascending) WHERE(Item Category Code=FILTER(10..103))

- Item Lookup by Unit Price of a Certain Value:       

  SORTING(Description) ORDER(Ascending) WHERE(Unit Price=FILTER(>0&<25))

- Item Lookup by Specific Inventory Posting Group            
SORTING(Description) ORDER(Ascending) WHERE(Inventory Posting Group=FILTER(SHOP))

- Item Lookup by Specific Description      
SORTING(Description) ORDER(Ascending) WHERE(Description=FILTER(@Bag))

- Item Lookup by Specific Vendor and Item Category        
SORTING(Description) ORDER(Ascending) WHERE(Vendor No.=FILTER(CR000001), Item Category Code =FILTER(DESK))
