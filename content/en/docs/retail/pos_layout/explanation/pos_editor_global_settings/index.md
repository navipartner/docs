You can navigate to the POS editor **Global Settings** by pressing the <image src="Images/cog.PNG" width="30" height="30"> button once you open the [<ins>POS editor<ins>]({{< ref "../pos_editor/index.md" >}}). Global settings contain three tabs containing options from Business Central pages - **Editor**, **Restaurant**, and **Maintenance**. 

## Editor

Modify options and settings pertaining to the editor functionalities. You can change the number of decimal spaces used to express prices, the POS editor global theme, as well as additional color customizations. Additionally, you can define the workflows that will be run on certain events. For legacy users, there's also an option to import a custom JSON code in the designated box. 

## Restaurant

This tab is intended for restaurant POS users only. You can add or modify admin buttons from here. 

## Maintenance

You can view the last error stack trace easily from this tab without having to open Business Central to interract with the error log.
