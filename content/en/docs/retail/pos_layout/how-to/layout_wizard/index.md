The main benefit of the wizard is the ability to set up a fully populated POS unit with a few clicks, instead of having to setup every button and menu individually. You may not get all the desired content in the predefined layout, but it's much quicker to add/remove the individual parts when the base is established. 

#### Prerequisites

- Enable the [<ins>POS Editor<ins>]({{< ref "../activate_pos_editor/index.md" >}}) to be able to use the POS Layout Setup Wizard.

#### Procedure

1. Open the POS.     
   The POS has an empty layout assigned to it, and you're prompted to select the layout from the Layout Setup Wizard. 
2. Choose the layout category from the Layout Setup Wizard, and press **Continue**.     
   You can opt for a **Caf√©**, **Attractions**, **Restaurant** or a **Retail** layout.
3. (Optional) If you don't want to start building the layout from a preset option, you can exit the Wizard to create a POS layout from scratch.
4. Select the language you wish the layout to be presented in, and press **Continue**.
5. Select one of the available presets, and press **Continue**.      
   Available presets are determined by the layout category selection.
6. Finalize the layout setup by confirming your selections in the final step.     
   The layout is now ready to be customized.
7. (Optional) If you're happy with the preset layout, you can save it by pressing **Save** in the ribbon up-top.      
   You can overwrite the previous save, or create a new one.
8. (Optional) If you wish to select a new layout category, click the icon (![weird_icon](Images/weird_icon.PNG)) in the top right corner of the edit-mode screen to reinitiate the layout setup.
9. Use the options in the ribbon to additionally customize the preset POS elements.     
   The options in the ribbon correspond to parts of the POS screen. For example, if you press **Sale Lines**, you will be prompted to select which sale line panel columns you wish to add/remove.
10. Once satisfied with the customization, press **Save**.
