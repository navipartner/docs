The main benefit of the wizard is the ability to set up a fully populated POS unit with a few clicks, instead of having to setup every button and menu individually. You may not get all the desired content in the predefined layout, but it's much quicker to add/remove the individual parts when the base is established. 

## Prerequisites

- Enable the [POS Editor]({{< ref "../../../pos_processes/how-to/activate_pos_editor/" >}}) to be able to use the POS Layout Setup Wizard.

## Procedure

1. Open the POS.     
   The POS has an empty layout assigned to it. 
2. Enter the **Edit** mode by pressing the cog icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.
3. Click the icon (![weird_icon](Images/weird_icon.PNG)) in the top right corner of the edit-mode screen.
4. Choose the layout category in the displayed pop-up window, and press **Continue**.     
   You can opt for either a **Cafe** or **Retail** setup for now.
5. Select the language you wish the layout to be presented in, and press **Continue**.
6. Select one of the available presets (e.g. Wine Shop), and press **Continue**.
7. Finalize the layout setup by confirming your selections in the final step.     
   The layout is now ready to be used.
