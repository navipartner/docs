External vouchers are issued by a 3rd party and accepted in the shop. This means that the configuration of the **Voucher Type Card** is a bit different. This portion of the POS Academy uses GS1 Gratis as an example for the external retail voucher setup.  

#### Prerequisites

- Create a POS Payment Method for GS1.    
  Gratis will be associated with the Retail Voucher which is a payment type rather that a discount type.

- Create the **POS Posting Setup** for that payment method.

#### Procedure

To create an **External Retail Voucher** follow the provided steps: 

1.	Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Retail Voucher Types**, and choose the related link.     
    A list of all existing **Retail Vouchers** is displayed.
2.	Click **New**.    
    The **Retail Voucher Card** pop-up window is displayed.
3.	Populate all necessary fields in the **General** section as indicated in the **Example** column.

| Field Name      | Description | Example | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Code** | Specifies the unique code for the voucher. | **GS1** | 
| **Description** | Specifies the name of the voucher. | **GS1 - Gratis** |
| **Voucher Qty (Open)**  | In case of GS1 vouchers, this field is always left blank as the vouchers are not generated by the store. | Leave it blank. | 
| **Arch. Coupon Qty** | This field is updated each time a voucher is accepted by the store. | The amount displayed |

4. Populate all necessary fields in the **Send Voucher** section as indicated in the **Example** column.

| Field Name      | Description | Example | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Send Voucher Module** | The DEFAULT module is set as required by system, but it isn’t used for this voucher type. | **DEFAULT** |
| **Account No.** | The GS1 account number is set as required by system, but it isn’t used for this voucher type. | **GS1 A/C no.** |
| **No. Series** | This no series is required by system, but it isn’t used for this voucher type. | **NPR-EXTERN** |
| **Arch. Coupon Qty** | This number series is required by system when archiving the voucher. | **NPR-EXTARC** |

  The other fields in this section are left blank as they are not used in this voucher type.

5.	Skip the **Setup Voucher** section as the fields in it aren’t related to the GS1.

6.	Populate all necessary fields in the **Validate Voucher** section.   
    In this section, only the **Validate Voucher Module** field needs to be set to **DEFAULT**, whereas other fields in this section should be skipped, as they aren’t related to the GS1.

7.	Populate all necessary fields in the **Apply Payment** section as indicated in the **Example** column.

| Field Name      | Description | Example | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Apply Payment Module** | The **DEFAULT** module is set as required by the system. | **DEFAULT** | 
| **Payment Type** | This field determines the relationship between the voucher and the payment mode used by the system. | **GS1** |

## POS Action for External Voucher on POS

On the POS menus, you need to define a button for scanning the coupon in the POS payment view. The **Action Type** used is **Payment**, with the **POS Payment Method GS1** as a parameter. There are no additional parameters to be added to the POS action. When the POS button is pressed, users are prompted to enter the amount and scan the coupon.

## Redeem External Vouchers on POS

The main difference between the basic POS Payment Method, and the External Vouchers is their processing type in the **POS Payment Method Card**.

When the voucher is scanned on the POS, a sales line is inserted with the description and the amount to be used as payment on the **Payment View**. The voucher entries will be created.
