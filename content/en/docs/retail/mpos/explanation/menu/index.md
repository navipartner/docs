This page contains the list of all created menus. Menus can be defined for all POS units or for specific ones, in which case it is necessary to provide the **POS Unit No.** of that specific POS unit. It is also possible to provide access to some menus only to specific salespeople, in which case the **Salesperson code** needs to be provided as well.
