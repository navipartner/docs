To set up the Shopify integration in NP Retail, make sure the prerequisites are met, and follow the provided steps:

### Prerequisites

1. Install the NP Retail application.                   
   The application's version should be 1700.9.50.10000 or newer.   

   {{< alert icon="❗" text="The NP Retail application needs to exist in the tenant database prior to the installation of Shopify integration extension." />}}

2. Install the Shopify extension in the customer tenant database.      

   A private application needs to be registered on the Shopify environment that Business Central should be connected to. Other than that, nothing needs to be developed on their side to complete the integration setup. We are using the existing Shopify capabilities (web services) to send data and get data from Shopify. All data transfers are initiated from the Business Central side.

### Procedure

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Shopify Integration Setup** and select the related link.      
   The window containing all integration areas that can be set up is displayed. You can choose which integration areas to enable, and specify the **Connection Parameters**.   

{{< alert icon="📝" text="To receive the <b>Shopify Access Token</b>, a private application needs to be created in the Shopify environment that Business Central can be connected to (Shopify admin page > Apps > Manage private apps). Additionally, both read and write permissions need to be assigned to the following entities: Inventory, Orders, and Products." />}}

2. To enable the integration, select the **Enable Integration** toggle switch, and then enable all the other options you need.   

{{< alert icon="📝" text="Whenever you change some of the values in this page, you need to sign into Business Central again before the changes are applied." />}}


## Next steps

The following procedures are optional, and whether you want to perform them or not depends solely on your business needs. They don't need to be completed in any specific order.
