Item categories are used in Business Central to group items that share certain characteristics. They make sorting, searching and report filtering much easier.

You can also establish a multi-level hierarchy of main item categories (parents) and subcategories (children) as demonstrated in the following screenshot and table.

|          |           |           |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Level 1 | (PARENT) | SHOP |
| Level 2 | (CHILD)	| JEWELRY | 
| Level 3 | (CHILDREN) | BRACELET, EARRINGS, NECKLACE |

In addition to item categories, you can predefine item attributes like style and make, that can be used for providing product specifications, or adding physical dimensions, like the material the jewelry is made of (gold, silver, platinum, etc.).

When creating item categories, the same item category card is used for creating both parent and children item categories.
