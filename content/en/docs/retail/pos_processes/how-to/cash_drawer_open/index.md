This topic section walks you through the process of setting up the POS Payment Bin to use OPOS to open the Cash Drawer through the POS.

### Prerequisites

- Have at least one [<ins>POS unit<ins>]({{< ref "../create_pos_unit/index.md" >}}).

- Have the OPOS CCO installed ([<ins>the 1.14.001 CCO installer<ins>](http://monroecs.com/oposccos_current.htm)).

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="Since different drivers are used for opening and handling cash drawers, there are different ways in which you can locate the name of the cash drawer locally on the POS. You can either set the <b>Logical Device Name</b> in the <b>Cash Drawer Driver</b> or in the <b>Registry Editor</b>."/>}}

  
### Procedure

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **POS Unit List**, and choose the related link.

   The POS unit with this POS payment bin is now using OPOS whenever opening the drawer in POS.
