A transfer journal is prepared in the back office, reflecting from which source POS payment bin the cash is taken, and to which target POS payment bin will the cash is sent. The transfer process itself is done in two steps:

1. The journal is released from the back office.      
   The **POS Payment Bin Transfer Journal** needs to be released so that the transferred cash becomes available on the receiving end. 
2. The journal is accepted on the POS. 

To create a POS Payment Bin Transfer Journal, and gain the ability to initiate cash transfer from the back office, make sure the prerequisites are met, and follow the provided steps:

#### Prerequisites

Before performing these transfers, you need to set up the rules that will govern them in the **Bin Transfer Profile** in Business Central. 

- Create a new **Bin Transfer Profile**, and enable the desired options.
- If you wish to print transfer slips as paper trail when the supervisor takes the cash to the POS, you need to create the adequate print templates, and attach them to the actions in the **Bin Transfer Profile**.
