| **Role Center** | The Business Center landing page. |
| **Role Explorer** | Opened from the **Role Center** by clicking the burger icon (three vertical lines in the top-right corner). Each element on the role explorer is an action that opens a page. Accordingly, you can also use the role explorer as a means to navigate in Business Central. |

| **Workflows** | A feature of NP Retail front end responsible for coordinating business logic that executes in response to button clicks in POS. There are two versions of workflows. Both version of workflows allow AL developers to write JavaScript code that executes in the front end, that invokes any back-end code only when necessary. | 
| **Workflows v1** | First iteration of workflows, based on custom-built API, that allows structuring AL code in the back end to support asynchronous behavior of JavaScript that's executing in the front end. Workflows v1 are an essential part of the Transcendence front-end framework. Workflows v1 were designed primarily with AL developers in mind, requiring minimum understanding of JavaScript while still being able to write most of front-end logic. |
| **Workflows v2** | Second iteration of workflows, based on JavaScript built-in [<ins>Promises API<ins>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) . This iteration is far more robust, it coordinates the entire execution of business logic from the front end, and includes some features Workflows v1 was uncapable of, such as parallel execution, nesting, sequencing, and similar. Workflows v2 are an essential part of Dragonglass. | 
| **Dimensions** | Values that categorize entries so you can track and analyze them on documents, such as sales orders. Dimensions can, for example, indicate the project or department an entry came from.
