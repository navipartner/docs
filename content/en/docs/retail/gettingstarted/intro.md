NP Retail is a solution that combines the functionalities of the POS and ERP systems based on [<ins>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central<ins>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/). This framework enables synchronizing data across different channels to offer information and insights to small and mid-sized businesses, and assisting them with improving overall customer service. Some of the improved business aspects include [<ins>financial management<ins>]({{< ref "../pos_processes/explanation/pricing.md" >}}), [<ins>accounting<ins>]({{< ref "../pos_profiles/how-to/posting_profile/posting_profile.md" >}}), management of orders and products, inventory management, [<ins>reports<ins>]({{< ref "../reports/intro.md" >}}), and [<ins>statistics<ins>]({{< ref "../pos_processes/reference/pos_info_card_ref.md" >}}), which are all merged into a single solution. 

At the core of NP Retail is a POS store. Each POS store contains multiple POS units used for conducting business. Daily work on POS involves going through the entirety of the sales cycle, which consists of preparing the opening balance, conducting the sales (while redeeming coupons and vouchers where appropriate), and finally performing the end-of-day procedure - posting the sales and syncing all relevant information with the ERP database.
