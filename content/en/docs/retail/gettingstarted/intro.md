NP Retail is a solution which combines the functionalities of the POS and ERP systems based on [<ins>Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central<ins>](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/). This framework enables synchronizing data across different channels to offer information and insights to small and mid-sized businesses, and assisting them with improving overall customer service. Some of the improved business aspects include [<ins>financial management<ins>]({{< ref "../pos_processes/explanation/pricing.md" >}}), [<ins>accounting<ins>]({{< ref "../pos_profiles/how-to/posting_profile/posting_profile.md" >}}), management of orders and products, inventory management, [<ins>reports<ins>]({{< ref "../reports/intro.md" >}}), and [<ins>statistics<ins>]({{< ref "../pos_processes/reference/pos_info_card_ref.md" >}}), which are all merged into a single solution.
