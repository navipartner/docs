NP Retail is a solution which combines the functionalities of the POS and ERP systems based on Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. This framework enables synchronizing data across different channels to offer information and insights to small and mid-sized businesses, and assisting them with improving overall customer service. Some of the improved business aspects include financial management, accounting, management of orders and products, inventory management, reports, and statistics, which are all merged into a single solution.
