The following article lists all system requirements for running our solutions. They are minimal, as solutions are cloud-based, and the Retail POS is operated through a browser. 

## Network

### Internet speed

| No. of Users | Minimum Speed |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1-5 simultaneous users    | 10/2Mbit |
| 6-9 simultaneous users    | 15/2Mbit |
| 10-14 simultaneous users  | 20/2Mbit |
| 15+ simultaneous users    | 20/2Mbit |
| Mobile broadband per user   |  2/2Mbit |

### Internet failover (recommended)

It's recommended to have a failover solution in case the Internet is down. It should be using an independent network. The solutions for this are as follows:

- A router with integrated 4G fallback, which switches the cabled Internet connection to 4G when it goes down, and/or
- A backup Internet connection which you can automatically switch over to when the primary Internet connection goes down. 

## Firewall setup

### Software

| Software   | WAN IP | Port(s) |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| Baxi (Viking) | 91.102.24.142; 212.226.157.243 | TCP: 9670/9680; TCP: 6001 | 
| BC/NAV RTC Client |  ALL | Different Per Customer | 
| BC/NAV SOAP | ALL | TCP: Different Per Customer | 
| BC/NAV ODATA | ALL | TCP: Different Per Customer | 
| FlexIITerm | 193.142.211.21/22 | TCP: 19000 |
| NP Deploy | ALL |  TCP: 7087 |
| NP Helper | 94.127.52.122 | TCP: 49000 |
| NP System Callback | ALL |  TCP: 7047 | 
| Remote Desktop | 81.27.209.0/24 | TCP: 3389 |
| TeamViewer | ALL | TCP: 80/433/5938 UDP: 5938 | 


### Hardware

| Hardware    | LAN IP | Port(s) |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Label Print (Zebra) | Fixed  | TCP: 9100 (LAN - Outbound) |
| Payment Terminal (Adyen) | DHCP | TCP: 443 (WAN) |
| Payment Terminal (Nets - PSAM) | Fixed |  TCP: 1234 (LAN - Outbound) |
| Payment Terminal (Verifone Denmark) | DHCP | TCP: 9600 (LAN - Inbound) |
| Receipt Print (Epson) | Fixed | TCP: 9100 (LAN - Outbound) | 

## Device connectivity

**Stationary PCs**

The basic POS setup requires up to 7 network ports. They are used for the label printer, receipt printer, payment terminal etc. The PC needs to be connected with a LAN cable. 

**Mobile Point of Sales (MPOS)**

MPOS devices such as phones and tablets should be connected via Wi-Fi with the 4G network at least. 

**Other devices**

Label printers, receipt printers, payment terminals, and other hardware need to be connected via LAN. They need to be on the same network as the PC used for the POS. We do not support devices connected via Direct Connect. 

**Wi-Fi** 

LAN and Wi-Fi need to be on the same subnet. It's recommended that all POS/MPOS equipment that runs on Wi-Fi gets its own SSID. All hardware that is connected via Wi-Fi needs to be on a stable connection. Devices that continuously switch between different Wi-Fi connections are at risk of causing errors. 

## Supported hardware

Our solution works with a wide variety of hardware. Feel free to reach out to us if you have hardware that isn't mentioned on this page. We will be happy to assess whether it can be used or not.
