Major Tom is Windows desktop POS software which embeds the web client and serves as a middleware between the web browser and the local hardware. Follow these steps to set up Major Tom:

1. [Download](https://clickonce.dynamics-retail.com/clickonce/majortom/install.html), and install the user interface.     
   You can choose between the 32-bit and the 64-bit version.   
2. Configure the URL to where the database is.      
   If this is a multi-tenant database environment, you need to configure the tenant as well.
3. To define which company a user will have access to, open **User Personalization**.
4. From **My Settings** menu, navigate to the company list that the user has access to and select the company the user works in.        
   This action also changes the default company attached to the user in the **User Personalization** menu.
