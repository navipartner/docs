## Next steps (Advanced setup)

### Install Major Tom

Refer to the [how-to guide]({{< ref "major_tom.md" >}}) for installing our desktop POS software.

### Install Minor Tom

Refer to the [how-to guide]({{< ref "minor_tom.md" >}}) for installing the abbreviated version of our desktop POS software. 

### Install ClickOnce

ClickOnce is a deployment technology that enables you to create self-updating Windows-based applications that can be installed and run with minimal user interaction. 

1. Click the **ClickOnce Client Installation** link from the email you received from NaviPartner when you requested a trial version of NP Retail.    
   The page containing the installation links is displayed.
2. Click **Install now**.
3. During the installation, you will need to provide credentials to log into Business Central.     
   It takes a few minutes to run for the first time, as all necessary .dll files need to be properly installed on your PC.
   After the installation is complete, you will be able to access Microsoft Dynamics NAV via ClickOnce.
