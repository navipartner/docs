You can connect one or more email accounts to Business Central and share information and documents, such as sales, purchase orders and invoices, via email directly from within. You can attach most types of documents in these emails in a form of a PDF. Alternatively, you can set up a report layout that includes information from the document in the email text.

You can compose each message individually with basic formatting tools, such as fonts, styles, colors, and so on, and add attachments of up to 100 MB.
