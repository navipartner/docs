description: "NP Email is a module that integrates directly with Twilio SendGrid. With NP Mail, email management is offloaded from Business Central, which no longer handles email delivery or template editing. Instead, SendGrid takes over, offering powerful tools for sending both transactional and marketing emails, ensuring high deliverability rates, and providing in-depth analytics on email performance."

NP Email is the new NaviPartner mailing system. It works via an integration to [<ins>Twillo SendGrid<ins>](https://www.twilio.com/en-us), a communication platform for transactional and marketing emails. The platform has an intuitive email template designer with drag and drop functionality, which allows you to create better email designs and provides more insights to deliverability. 
With NP Mail, email management is offloaded from Business Central providing in-depth analytics on email performance.
Currently supporting data providers such as Membership and Ticketing, NP Mail allows you to create dynamic email templates within SendGrid that leverage real-time data from Business Centralâ€”enhancing personalization and automation across your email campaigns.
