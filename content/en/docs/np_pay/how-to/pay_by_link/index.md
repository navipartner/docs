## Next steps

### View the details

After creating Pay by Link, you can see the details by opening the **Related** dropdown from the selected document (sales order, sales invoice, posted sales invoice), and clicking **Pay by Link** > **Payment Lines**. 

   ![pay_by_link_lines](Images/pay_by_link_lines.PNG)

   The following fields and options are used to define payment lines:

   | Field Name      | Description |
   | ----------- | ----------- |
   | **Requested Amount** | Specifies the amount that is requested to be paid via Pay by Link. | 
   | **Payment ID** | Specifies the unique identifier associated with each Pay by Link transaction. |
   | **Expires At** | Specifies the deadline by which the customer needs to complete the payment. When the specified date and time expires, Pay by Link becomes invalid. |
   | **Pay by Link URL** | Contains the unique URL generated for the customer to make a payment via Pay by Link. This URL directs the customer to a secure payment page. |

After authorization is completed, the **Payment Lines** are automatically populated with **Transaction ID**, **Authorized Amount**, and **Authorization Date**. Subsequently, the payment amount can either be captured automatically upon posting or triggered manually. During authorization, the corresponding amount is reserved on the customer's credit card, and that amount is deducted from the credit card balance after the payment is captured.

   | Field Name      | Description |
   | ----------- | ----------- |
   | **Transaction ID** | Specifies the unique identifier for each payment transaction processed through Pay by Link. |
   | **Amount** | Specifies the amount that is paid via Pay by Link. | 
   | **Date Authorized** | Specifies the date when the payment has been authorized. |
   | **Posting Error** | Indicates whether an error has occurred during the posting process. |
   | **Skip Posting** | Specifies if the posting process needs to be bypassed for a particular record or a batch. |
   | **Retry Posting Count** | Sets the number of attempts to retry posting in the initial attempt has failed. | 

### Check email log

You can check the pay-by-link email log by navigating to **Related** > **Pay by Link** > **Pay by Link E-mail Log** from the **Payment Line List**. The email log allows users to view the log of emails sent for Pay by Link transactions. The log includes details such as an email address, date, and the time sent, as well as the status of the email delivery. 

### Resend Pay by Link

You can resend Pay by Link to customers by navigating to **Related** > **Pay by Link** > **Resend Pay by Link** from the **Payment Line List**. An identical form to the one used for generating Pay by Link previously is created as a result. The **Amount** and **Expiry Date** fields are non-editable, as the Pay by Link has already been issued. 

   ![resend_pay_by_link](Images/resend_pay_by_link.PNG)

### Cancel Pay by Link

You can cancel an active Pay by Link by navigating to **Related** > **Pay by Link** > **Cancels Pay by Link** from the **Payment Line List**. Once cancelled, the link becomes invalid, and the customer is no longer able to use it to make a payment. The **Manually Cancelled Link** switch is activated and **Expires At** is changed to the current date and time. 

### Cancel payment

You can cancel the payment via the **Cancel Payment** action in the **Payment Line List** ribbon. This action prevents the transaction from being finalized, and ensures that no funds are transferred from the customer's account. 

### View posting log

You can reach the **Posting Log** from the **Payment Line List** by clicking the appropriate action in the ribbon. It brings up a detailed log of all posting activities, including successes, errors, and retry attempts for a selected **Payment Line**.
