NP Pay is NaviPartner's payment service provider. Currently, only the [<ins>cloud architecture<ins>](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/choose-your-architecture/cloud/) is supported, whereby the POS and the payment terminal communicate via the Internet. However, it will also be possible to establish [<ins>local network communication<ins>](https://docs.adyen.com/point-of-sale/design-your-integration/choose-your-architecture/local/) between the POS and the terminal in the future. 

  {{< alert icon="📝" text="NaviPartner's solutions are also compatible with multiple external payment service providers, although we offer full support only for NP Pay."/>}}
