When encountering a printer-related issue, it's generally a good idea to start by turning the printer off and on again.

#### There's no text on the receipt. How can I fix this?

- Ask the customer to take the paper out of the printer and turn it 180 degrees and then reinsert it again.

#### Why can't I turn my receipt printer on?

- Try one of the following solutions:
  - Check if the printer is turned on.
  - Check if the power supply is connected to the printer.
  - Check if the power supply and the power cable are attached together.
  - Check if the power cable is connected to the power plug.
- If none of these solutions work, the printer or the power supply may be broken.

#### What can I do if the feed function doesn't work?

- Check if there's enough paper in the printer.
- Take the paper out of the printer, and reinsert it.
- If none of these solutions work, the printer or the power supply may be broken.

#### I can't print a local test page. What can I do?

- Check if the printer is installed with the **Generic/Text Only** driver.
- Check if the printer is connected by a network cable or a USB cable. If the customer can't answer this question, ask them to send you a picture of the printer's backside so you can take a look.
- Check if the printer is installed on the correct IP address or USB port.
- Check if there are any printer jobs in queue that have failed. If yes, delete them, and try to print a new test page.
- Check if the **Use Printer Offline** option is enabled.
