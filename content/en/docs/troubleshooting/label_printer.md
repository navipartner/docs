When encountering a printer-related issue, t's generally a good idea to start by turning the printer off and on again.

#### The text isn't placed correctly on the labels. What can I do to fix this?

- Make sure that the label is placed correctly inside the printer and calibrate the printer.

#### How can I check whether the printer issues are power-related?

- Check if the printer is turned on.
- Check if the power supply is connected to the printer.
- Check if the power supply and the power cable are attached together.
- Check if the power cable is connected to a power plug.
- If the answer to all previous question is "yes", the power supply or the printer itself may be broken.

#### How can I check whether the feed function works properly?

- Check if there is enough paper in the printer. If there's enough paper, take the paper out of the printer, and reinsert it. 
- Check if there's ribbon in the printer. If yes, then take the ribbon out of the printer, and reinsert it. 
- If none of these work, the power supply or the printer itself may be broken. 

#### I can't print a local test page. What can I do?

- Check if the printer is installed with the **Generic/Text Only** driver.
- Check if the printer is connected by a network cable or a USB cable. If the customer can't answer this question, ask them to send you a picture of the printer's backside so you can take a look.
- Check if the printer is installed on the correct IP address or USB port.
- Check if there are any printer jobs in queue that have failed. If yes, delete them, and try to print a new test page.
- Check if the **Use Printer Offline** option is enabled.

#### I can't print a label item card from Business Central. How can I fix this?

- Check if the printer is named correctly in the **Object Output Selection** administrative section. If this isn't an issue, create a case.
