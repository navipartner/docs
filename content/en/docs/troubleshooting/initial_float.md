#### How to fix incorrect initial float?

If a mistake is made, when the salesperson opens the POS unit for the first time, they will have the option to count and correct the error. They will receive the confirmation screen which states if the physical float is the same as the float inserted in the **POS Payment Bin Set Float** page.

If the floats don't match, the salesperson can perform a count, and balance the POS unit before they begin working on it. The salesperson needs to click **No** in the **Confirm Bin Contents** window, and they will be prompted to confirm whether the bin should be balanced. 

When the salesperson clicks **Yes**, the window for balancing will be displayed, and the salesperson will be able to correct the initial float.
