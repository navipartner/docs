When encountering a printer-related issue, it's generally a good idea to start by turning the printer off and on again.

#### How can I check whether the printer issues are power-related?

- Check if the printer is turned on.
- Check if the power supply is connected to the printer.
- Check if the power supply and the power cable are attached together.
- Check if the power cable is connected to a power plug.
- If the answer to all previous question is "yes", the power supply or the printer itself may be broken.

#### I can't print a local test page. What can I do?

- Check if the printer is installed with the correct driver from the manufacturer's website.
- Check if the printer is connected by a network cable or a USB cable. If the user doesn't know the answer to this question, ask them to provide a picture of the back of the printer.
- Check if the printer is installed on the correct IP address or USB port.
