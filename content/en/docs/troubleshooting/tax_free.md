#### I forgot to enable tax-free before finalizing the sale. How can I reprint the voucher?

If you forgot to enable tax-free before finalizing the sale or if you want to reprint the voucher, you can do so from the **Audit Roll** by selecting the correct sale, and clicking **Tax Free** under **Actions**.

  {{< alert icon="📝" text="If no vouchers associated with the selected sale can be found, you can issue a new one. If you do so, the creation process will be the same as when done from the POS, and the voucher will be printed."/>}}

You can also reprint the existing vouchers from the **Tax Free Voucher** page by clicking **Print Voucher**, while selecting the correct line.
