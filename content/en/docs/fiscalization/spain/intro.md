NP Retail is integrated with Fiskaly SIGN ES APIs, with API calls determined by the applicable business territory. The solution supports two APIs: TicketBAI and Verifactu.

- The Verifactu API is integrated into the solution but remains inaccessible to end users until the POS declaration is approved by the tax authority (TA).
- The TicketBAI API is included in the solution and is available for clients operating in Araba, Bizkaia, and Gipuzkoa.

For the rest of Spain, compliance is governed by Verifactu legislation, which applies to the following regions: Andalusia, Aragon, Principality of Asturias, Cantabria, Castilla-La Mancha, Castile and Le√≥n, Catalonia, Extremadura, Galicia, Balearic Islands, La Rioja, Madrid Region, Murcia Region, and Valencian Community.

To configure NP Retail to comply with Spanish fiscal laws, refer to the [<ins>how-to guide<ins>]({{< ref "how-to/setup/index.md" >}}).
