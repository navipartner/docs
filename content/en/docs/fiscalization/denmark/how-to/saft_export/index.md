You can initiate data export compliant with the Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) format for cash registers. In Denmark, the SAF-T format adheres to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standard, and serves as the designated file format for reporting. The exported file will be in XML format, and downloaded to the user's computer as soon as the export is finalized.

To export the SAF-T XML file, follow the provided steps:

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **SAF-T Cash Register Exports**, and open the related link.
2. Request data export by clicking **New**.     
   A new page is displayed. In it, you can provide the starting and ending dates of the data record as well as actions for exporting the data for the specified period.
3. Click **Start** to initiate the data export.    
   If **Parallel Processing** is disabled, you will be prompted to confirm that you wish the export to be performed.   
   When the export is completed, information on the exported data for the specified period is displayed in the **Lines** tab.    
   All transactions are recorded in the **POS Entry List**, and all cash register activities in  the **POS Audit Log** page.
4. Click **Download Files**.    
   A ZIP file is downloaded to your computer.
