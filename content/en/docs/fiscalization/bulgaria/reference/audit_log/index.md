The **BG POS Audit Log Aux. Info** page contains information on every POS transaction that is created from all POS units and POS stores.

The following fields and actions are especially relevant:

| Action Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Show Request Content** | Displays the information sent to the printer, e.g. salesperson code, POS unit number, payment method, and details on purchased items. | 
| **Send to Fiscal Printer** | If there's no response from the printer, i.e. the entries weren't assigned the corresponding **Grand Receipt No.** and **Receipt Timestamp**, this action is used for resending the request to the printer. |
