The following administrative sections are used for configuring the Kitchen setup as a part of the Restaurant module:

## Kitchen Stations

You can define how many kitchen stations are going to be in charge of preparing meals/drinks for a restaurant in the **Kitchen Stations** administrative section. There can be at least two kitchen stations in the system.

## Kitchen Station Selection Setup

In this section, you can define the sequence in which a meal passes from one station to another. There are preparations that can be done in parallel or as a part of a sequence. 

For example, in preparation of a Burger bundle meal, you can prepare the burger and the fries in parallel, but the full order will still be transferred to the packing station when both productions are completed.
