The NP Restaurant module aims to facilitate activities in restaurant and café environments. It supports a restaurant setup with multiple table locations, order-taking, moving of orders, kitchen information, and split billing.

With our cloud-based POS solution for restaurants and cafés, you can serve your guests in an efficient and convenient manner, reduce the ordering, as well as the waiting time, and offer quick payment. Orders are automatically sent to the kitchen printer to save time and avoid any potential misunderstandings.

If you wish to use the Restaurant module, you first need to log into the NP Retail Restaurant Role to land on the Role Center for the NP Retail Restaurant. From there, you can get an overview of what's happening in the restaurant, as well as the configuration screens required to set up the Restaurant environment in Business Central.
