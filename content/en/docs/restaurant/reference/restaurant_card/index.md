You can define the general information and behavior of the restaurant's system in the **Restaurant Card**: 

| Field Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Code/Name** | Specifies the name of the restaurant. If the restaurant is a part of a building complex, there can be several restaurant types in which the serving procedure and the production integration need to be defined. | 
| **Service Flow Profile** | Specifies the service flow profile assigned to the restaurant. Service flow profiles define general restaurant service flow options, such as the stage at which the waiter pads need to be closed, when the seating needs to be cleared, etc. In the case of a fast food restaurant, the service flow profile should ideally be **FastFood restaurant with payment upfront**. |
| **Default Number of Guests** | Specifies the default number of guests when a new waiter pad is created in a restaurant. **Default** implies that the value is going to be inherited from the restaurant setup. The option you select here can be overridden for each seating location individually. | 


#### Restaurant configuration examples

- **Fine-dining restaurant** - This is an Ã  la carte restaurant in which payment is carried out after dining. It has more than one kitchen station that prepares the food. 
- **Burger place** - Payment is carried out as soon as the order is placed, before serving. It has one kitchen in the back area. 
- **Pizza place** - Payment is carried out as soon as the order is placed, before serving. The food is prepared in front of the customer.
