If the adequate setup is performed, retail vouchers sold in offline shops can be redeemed both on POS and in Shopify. The integration can be enabled for each individual retail voucher type. 

     {{< alert icon="📝" text="Retail vouchers are created as gift cards in Shopify."/>}}

1. Click the ![Lightbulb](Lightbulb_icon.PNG) button, enter **Retail Voucher Types** and select the related link.      
2. Select the **Retail Voucher Type Card**, and enable the Shopify integration via the **Integrate with Shopify** toggle switch.
3. Provide the **Shopify Store Code**.       
   The store code should correspond to the Shopify store with which retail vouchers of this type are integrated. 

   {{< alert icon="📝" text="You can only integrate a retail voucher type with a single Shopify store (the system doesn't support integrating the same retail voucher type with multiple Shopify stores)." />}}
