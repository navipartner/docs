Shopify is an ecommerce platform that can be used for building online and offline stores. It offers online retailers services that include payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement tools.

NaviPartner out-of-the-box Shopify integration functionality supports the following Shopify integration areas:

- Product data sync from Business Central to Shopify (live)

    {{< alert icon="❗" text="NaviPartner desn't currently support linking Business Central items to Shopify product variants. If it is a product variant on Shopify's end, it also needs to be created as an item variant in Business Central." />}}

- Product modification sync from Shopify to Business Central (live)
- Inventory sync from Business Central to Shopify (live)
- Getting orders from Shopify to Business Central (every 5 minutes or any other interval you choose). Two types of integration are supported here: 
  - **Order processing is done on the Shopify side**: new orders are imported from Shopify and automatically posted once the updated information on completed orders is received (or deleted, if the order was cancelled in Shopify).
  - **Order processing is done in Business Central**: new orders are imported from Shopify, and users need to process them in Business Central
- Retail voucher sync from Business Central to Shopify (live)       

   {{< alert icon="📝" text="Retail vouchers are created as gift cards in Shopify."/>}}

   {{< alert icon="📝" text="<i>Live</i> means that synchronization occurs as soon as something is changed. However, there may be a one-minute-delay as the changes are processed via a job queue that runs every minute."/>}}
