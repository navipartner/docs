The following setups are generated automatically when necessary. They don't require any action on your part.

## Data log subscribers

Data log subscribers are required if the system needs to keep track of changes done to the data. They are automatically generated if the relevant Shopify integration area is enabled. 

The list of automatically generated data log subscribers is contained in the **Data Log Subscribers** administrative section.

All data log subscribers should have **Delayed Data Processing (sec)** set to **20**. 

{{< alert icon="📝" text="Direct data processing shouldn't be set to <i>yes</i> except when used in the context of test/sandbox environments, as this may result in incorrect inventory levels being sent to Shopify." />}}


## Job Queue Entries

The job queue entries are required for automating the regular data exchange between Business Central and Shopify. They are in control of:

 - Processing both NC task list and NC import list entries. 
 - Running specific Shopify-related tasks, like retrieving Shopify orders and handling Shopify webhook notifications. 

The job queue entries are created automatically once the relevant integration areas are enabled.

By default, the following job queue entries are created automatically:

|          Event                                                                                                |            Job Queue Entry Created               |

## Import types

Import types are needed to process data received from external sources, like Shopify.

  ![import_types_shopify](Images/import_types_shopify.PNG)

The following import types are needed for the integration (all of them are related to the [<ins>**Sales Order Integration**<ins>]({{< ref "../../how-to/sales_order_setup/index.md" >}}) area)

| Code                   | Description             | Import List Update Handler      | Import List Process Handler     |  Import List Lookup Handler      |
