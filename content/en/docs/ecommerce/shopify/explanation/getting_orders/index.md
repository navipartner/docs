New Shopify orders and order updates are downloaded from Shopify automatically. Two periodic processes are responsible for that ([<ins>refer to **Job Queue Entries**<ins>]({{< ref "../../reference/autogenerated_setup/index.md" >}}) for reference). 


1. The connection with the Shopify servers is established, and query for new, cancelled and closed orders is performed. The results are saved in the **Import List**.

{{< alert icon="📝" text="The process doesn't request all orders from Shopify, only those created/updated in Shopify after the last request has been run, or after the date/time specified in the <b>Get Orders Starting From</b> field on the <b>Shopify Store</b> page (whichever occurs later)."/>}}

2. New entries (retrieved during the first process) in the **Import List** are processed, and consequently sales orders are updated (the new ones are created, the cancelled ones are deleted, and the closed ones are posted).

{{< alert icon="❗" text="It's recommended to periodically check the <b>Job Queue Log Entries</b> and the <b>Import List</b> to make sure any potential errors are addressed."/>}}

All created sales orders in the system are assigned a **Shopify Order ID**.

For the purpose of reporting the order progress (shipping items to the customer) back to Shopify, each **Sales Order Line** also gets assigned its own **Shopify Order Line ID**.

## Customer search routine

Customers are selected by using the **Customer search routine**. During the order import, the following customer lookup algorithm is applied:

1. The customer is looked up by their **Shopify ID**.                   
   ![customer_search](Images/customer_search.PNG)

   {{< alert icon="📝" text="Each time a customer is created during the Shopify order import process, the customer's Shopify ID is stored in the <b>Shopify Customer ID</b> field on the <b>Customer Card</b>."/>}}

2. If the customer isn't found in the first step, the system attempts to find another customer either by email, phone, or both (depending on the provided value in the **Customer Mapping** field on the **E-commerce Store Card**).    
   If the system finds a matching customer at this stage, the Shopify ID will be assigned to them, so that the next time they can be found during the first stage (Shopify ID lookup).         

{{< alert icon="❗" text="The system will not use a customer if their Shopify ID is different than the one received in the order, even if the email/phone number is the same."/>}}

3. If the customer still hasn't been found, the system creates a new customer if the **Allow Create Customers** option is enabled in the **E-commerce Store Card**.           
   In this case, the system uses the customer template specifies in the **Customer Config. Template Code** field on the **E-commerce Store Card**. The template is needed to fill-in fields and values which aren't sent to Shopify, but are required in Business Central.      
   If **Allow Create Customers** is disabled, the system uses a predefined customer (assigned to the store through customer mappings, or directly specified in the **Customer No.** field on the **E-commerce Store Card**).
