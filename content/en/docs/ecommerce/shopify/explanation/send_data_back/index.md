There are two events in the system, which will prompt data to be sent to Shopify:

## Sales order posted as shipment

When a sales order is posted as a shipment, the system needs to send a request to create a [<ins>fulfilment<ins>](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/orders/fulfillment) in Shopify. 

This task can be achieved through the **NaviConnect Task List**. Each fulfillment request is created as a task list entry. The task list entry is then processed by a job queue (the job queue responsible for processing the task list is [<ins>automatically created<ins>]({{< ref "../../reference/autogenerated_setup/index.md" >}})).

Partial shipments are allowed; therefore, each request includes only the items/quantities actually shipped to the customer.

## Sales order posted as invoice.

After a sales order has been posted as an invoice, the system needs to capture payments. This is done in several steps:

1. When an order is posted, a task list entry is automatically created. When that entry is executed, the necessary data is retrieved from Shopify, and all authorized payments are saved with the posted sales invoice. This information is saved in the **Payment Line List** page, which can be opened from the [<ins>posted **Sales Invoice**<ins>](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dynamics365/business-central/sales-how-invoice-sales) card.       
For each payment line, the system creates another **Task List** entry, which will be executed in the next step.

2. Each payment that has been retrieved during the previous step is processed in the system, a capture request is sent for each payment line, and, if the request is successful, the payment line is marked as captured.
