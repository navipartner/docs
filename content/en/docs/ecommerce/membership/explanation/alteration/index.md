It's possible to configure all membership alteration types such as upgrades, renewals, and extensions in the **Membership Alteration** administrative section in Business Central.

All of these alteration types, except for membership cancellation, can be accessed in Magento Webadmin, if you navigate to **Catalog** > **Products**, and open the **Add Products** dropdown. Each alteration type is linked to a distinct item number.

  {{< alert icon="❗" text="The <b>Membership Alteration</b> table is mainly used for retrieving the necessary sales item numbers, or other related details. Nothing should be modified in it. These sales items should be marked as Magento items, and synced with the Magento Webadmin database."/>}}
