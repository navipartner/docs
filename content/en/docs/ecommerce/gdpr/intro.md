The GDPR module allows online stores to comply with the essential GDPR (General Data Protection) regulations and guidelines for user data protection. 

This module comes with the **Privacy Consent** dashboard that stores all GDPR options in one place. Customers can view the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, download account data, and delete their accounts, if needed.
