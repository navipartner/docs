# Useful information

A content folder is automatically a section **if the folder has an index file called _index.md**. This causes Hugo to create a navigable URL for the section. For example, if content/about-us/_index.md exists, Hugo would create xyzcompany.com/about-us/.

The sections can be nested as deeply as you want. The important thing to understand is that to make the section tree fully navigational, at least the lower-most section must include a content file. (i.e. _index.md).

## _index.md vs index.md

- Branch bundle ‚Äî Its index file is called _index.md. It can have ‚Äúchildren,‚Äù such as nested folders. If there are additional .md files within, each will get its own navigable URL. As we hinted earlier, only a folder that‚Äôs a branch bundle can be a section. By default, Hugo treats its index file as a list of the section‚Äôs contents, but, as we‚Äôll see, you can exercise more control over this.

- Leaf bundle ‚Äî Its index file is called index.md and, at build time, becomes a regular web page, not a list. It can‚Äôt be a section, and therefore can have no ‚Äúchildren.‚Äù Any additional .md file in a leaf bundle won‚Äôt get its own navigable URL Other items within a leaf bundle are page resources for the index.md file (more on that in the following example).

## Referencing global images

Place images in the 'static' folder (NOT static/images), and then act as if they are located in the same folder as the article you're referencing them from.

## Editing article body width

Edit the "width" param in the assets/scss/common/_global.scss file. Currently, it is set to 800px, and 900px would mess up with the table of contents.
